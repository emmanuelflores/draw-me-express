===============
You will notice that my paths are set as '../node_modules/express'. Because I try to keep my packages locally I have created on my computer a workspace which contains the node_modules folder inside a Node-Workspace. Web apps are placed at the same hierarchy, so in order to access the modules we need to ../node_modules/_name_package.

Node-Workspace/node_modules. Node-Workspace/yourApp.

You can install the node packages globally (-g) and make use of them as: require('name')
